# Frontend Page - Fetch

This is the readme file for the frontend page of the Intercontinental Bridge project. The page is implemented using React and allows users to interact with the blockchain using the IPFS protocol.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Introduction

The Fetch frontend page is part of the Intercontinental Bridge project, enabling users to interact with the blockchain and IPFS through a user-friendly interface. Users can connect their wallets, view wallet connection status, and perform various actions related to token bridging between different chains.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need the following tools:

- Node.js (version 16.14.1 or later)
- npm (version 8.5.0 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To use the Fetch frontend page, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the backend and smart contract components of the Intercontinental Bridge project set up and running.

2. Connect your wallet using the provided options on the page.

3. Once your wallet is connected, you can view the connection status and other relevant information.

4. Enter the amount you want to bridge in the "Enter Amount to Bridge" input field.

5. Click the "Bridge Token to Moonbeam" button to initiate the token bridging process (Note: This feature is currently commented out in the
